# MarsRoverPhotoApp

The solution contains 2 Projects
 1) Console App which downloads all the images from API and dumps them in provided destination folder
 2) Angular Project to display all the images in a gallery
 3) Test project. Xunit tests to test the functionality.( Added only two test in the intrest of time)

Added docker support for both the projects. While giving the path we need to make sure the path is compatable with environment/OS

Below are the screen shots of the Apps while developing them in my local
